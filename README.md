The Ragsite

## Getting Set Up

`gulp` is required to build the site. Install by typing:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Then go into the project folder and type:

```
npm install
```

Start working on the site by typing:

```
gulp
```

This will build the site and open a browser window. Live reload is enabled, and will automatically rebuild the site when changes are detected.

## Publishing

Once built, the `dist` folder can be published in its entirety.
